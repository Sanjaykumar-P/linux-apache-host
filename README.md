“This project helped me build real-world experience in Linux server management and Apache web hosting, while also using AI (ChatGPT) to improve frontend and JavaScript coding.”
A Simple and Real-Time Weather App Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Hosted Using Apache on Linux.
💪 Core Skill Highlight

> 🔥 **Main Skill Showcased:** Hosting a Web Application using **Apache Web Server on Linux**  
> 🤖 **Code Support:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code were written and improved using **ChatGPT AI guidance**.

This project mainly showcases my **hands-on experience** in deploying a website through **Apache server** on a Linux machine. I handled:

- Apache installation and configuration
- Moving files to `/var/www/html/`
- Managing Linux file permissions
- Accessed via: `http://localhost/` on my Apache server (Linux)
